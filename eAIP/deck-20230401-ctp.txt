==== DNMM (Lagos, Nigeria) ====

  * For DNMM, you have access to a large number of pages at the [[dnmm|DNMM]] eAIP pages.
  * We will keep specific Cross the Pond information (aerodrome operations, departures) in this page.

=== Overview ===

  * Both runways will be operational. Runway 18R will be operating exclusively for departures with the exception of any arriving cargo flight. Runway 18L will be used for arrivals.
  * Taxiway F will be operating exclusively toward runway 18R. Departures will have priority over arrivals.

=== Delivery ===

  * There is a Release Management sheet available to manage RFL and slot assignment.
  * Aircraft on Main Apron to depart runway 18R.
  * Aircraft East of runway 18L or at the FBO to depart runway 18L.
  * Use of the [[alias-std|Alias]] (.pdc1 and .pdc2) is recommended.

=== Ground ===

  * If required, we may open DNMM_E_GND to cover the apron east of runway 18L.
  * Traffic on F will have priority on traffic in the Aprons.
  * Hand over traffic to Tower with the Monitor Frequency phraseology.

=== Departures ===

  * Pilots will see some discontinuities on their departures. That is ok, they will be given DIRECTS by APPROACH.


==== FACT (Cape Town, South Africa) ====

  * For FACT, you have access to a large number of pages at the [[fact|FACT]] eAIP pages.
  * We will keep specific Cross the Pond information (aerodrome operations, departures) in this page.

=== Overview ===

=== Delivery ===

  * There is a Release Management sheet available to manage RFL and slot assignment.
  * Initial Climb will be FL090 and everyone will be departing via the IMSOM fix.
  * Use of the [[alias-std|Alias]] (.pdc1 and .pdc2) is recommended. Be aware that the alias file for FASA differs fromt the standard (STD) but those two are available.

=== Ground ===

  * If required, we may open FACT_E_GND to cover the apron east of runway 01/19.
  * Traffic on A will have priority on traffic pushing back.
  * Hand over traffic to Tower with the Monitor Frequency phraseology.
  * Runway 16/34 will remain closed during the event.

=== Departures ===

  * The Initial Climb should appear automatically on all Flight Plans for SAEZ and SBGR via IMSOM, but remember to check.

^ Departure ^ Destination ^ Runway ^ SID ^ Initial Climb ^ Remarks ^
| FACT      | SAEZ        | 01    | IMSO1A | FL090 | - |
| :::       | :::         | 19    | IMSO1B | FL090 | - |

| :::       | :::         | 19    | IMSO1B | FL090 | - |

  * FACT_TWR shall coordinate with FACT_APP the release of aircraft. Slots have been scheduled for 3 minute separation. Avoid pushing the Wake Turbulence separation to the minimum.

==== Enroute Operations ====

  * SELCAL should be checked once as soon as they reach Cruise Level.
  * Away From Cockpit is not an issue on Cruise Level, after SELCAL check. Report AFK return time via RMK (see Remarks tips at the bottom).

=== Johannesburg Oceanic ===

== Separation ==

  * 10 NM at all Routes.
  * RVSM Westbound Horizontal between FL290 and FL410.

== SELCAL, CPDLC and SLOP ==

  * SELCAL should be made available at DGAC, GLRB and GOOO.
  * CPDLC is not controller mandatory, but we highly recommend it at DGAC, GLRB and GOOO.
  * SLOP should be made available to pilots at 1 NM RIGHT or 2 NM RIGHT should they request.

== Procedures ==

  * FAJO Oceanic begins at ITLIK (B1) / ITMEK (B2) but we might have aircraft contact FAJO_FSS after ASPIK.
  * Aircraft should establish Mach Number Cruise at Cruise Level.
  * Assigned Cruise Levels will be determined by Delivery to establish separation.
  * Position Reporting not required.
  * Handover to SAEF (B1) at MUNES and to SBAO (B2) at ITGIV.

=== Accra, Roberts and Dakar Enroute ===

== Separation ==

  * 10 Min MNT (Mach Number Technique) at all Routes (we're simulating RNP 10 routes).
  * RVSM Westbound Horizontal between FL290 and FL410.

== SELCAL, CPDLC and SLOP ==

  * SELCAL should be made available at DGAC, GLRB and GOOO.
  * CPDLC is not controller mandatory, but we highly recommend it at DGAC, GLRB and GOOO.
  * SLOP should be made available to pilots at 1 NM RIGHT or 2 NM RIGHT should they request.

== Procedures ==

=== Accra, Dakar and Sal Oceanic ===

== Separation ==

  * 10 Min MNT (Mach Number Technique) at all Routes (we're simulating RNP 10 routes).
  * RVSM Westbound Horizontal between FL290 and FL410.

== SELCAL, CPDLC and SLOP ==

  * SELCAL should be made available at DGAC, GLRB and GOOO.
  * CPDLC is not controller mandatory, but we highly recommend it at DGAC, GLRB and GOOO.
  * SLOP should be made available to pilots at 1 NM RIGHT or 2 NM RIGHT should they request.

== Procedures ==

== Crossroads ==

  * Traffic on Route Red Three (R3) from DNMM to SKBO Westbound on Even Flight Levels will be moved down or up to an Odd Flight Level for the Crossroads Crossing.
  * Traffic on Route Green One (G1) from LEMD to SBGR will be kept on Even Flight Levels.

==== Non Event Traffic ====

=== Departures ===

  * Event Traffic has priority.
  * Non Event Traffic from DNMM or FACT flying to airports North, East or South may be given clearance and released for departure as appropriate. Use your best judgement.
  * Flights departing from FACT to any airport in South America require approval from the TMU Coordinator.
  * Flights departing from DNMM to any airport in West Africa or South America require approval from the TMU Coordinator.

=== Enroute ===

  * Non Event Traffic shall be maintained at FL300 or below if in conflict with any Event Traffic.
  * If Controllers unable to coordinate Non Event Traffic (to be reviewed case per case), feel free to drop them below FL250 and send them to Advisory Frequency.
  * Report all instances to the TMU Coordinator.

==== Other Information ====

  * Have fun!
  * Do not disconnect from your position until relieved. If the next controller is late, notify VATSSA1 and we'll sort something out.

=== RMK Field Best Practice ===

  * AFL360 confirms the Approved Flight Level from Delivery. In case the pilot disconnects and FP hasn't been ammended.
  * SLCL confirms the SELCAL Code has been checked and pilot is on SELCAL watch.
  * CPDLC confirms the pilot is connect via CPDLC (and the Controller is using CPDLC external to EuroScope or TopSky)
  * AFK1445 confirms the pilot is away from the keyboard and expected to return by 1445z.

  * If you need to add a callsign, please modify the flight plan and add the CALLSIGN/AIRLINEX field to the Other field.
