===== How to Share Knowledges / Updates to Procedures via GitHub Issues =====

  * First, go to [[https://github.com/|GitHub]] and create an account. If you already have an account, simply sign in.

  * Next, head over to [[https://github.com/VATSIM-SSA|VATSSA's GitHub organization profile]] by visiting the link, or searching in the search bar.

  * After you opened VATSSA's profile, in the top navigation bar, click on the <code>Repositories</code> button. Each of VATSSA's FIRs or sectors has its own repository. Find the relevant repository for your area, such as [[https://github.com/VATSIM-SSA/sectorfile-fasa|"sectorfile-fasa"]] , under the <code>Repositories</code> tab .

  * Alternatively, you can access any sector by following this [[https://github.com/VATSIM-SSA/sectorfile-ICAO|URL]], replacing <code>ICAO</code> with the appropriate ICAO code: https://github.com/VATSIM-SSA/sectorfile-ICAO .

  * When inside a repository page, you will see several tabs at the top (e.g., <code>Code</code>, <code>Issues</code>, <code>Pull Requests</code>). Click on the <code>Issue`s tab</code> , or go directly to the sector's issues page by visiting: https://github.com/VATSIM-SSA/sectorfile-ICAO/issues (replacing <code>ICAO</code> with the sector's ICAO code).

  * You now found the issue section of the VATSSA Sector Files. This is where we keep track of all things we can work on. If you are looking for something to help with, issues is the right place to start. You can also create issues on the issue page for bugs, or suggestion, or to share knowledge with us. If you are working on something, we appropriate it if you can create a issue, or comment on a issue, to tell all the other contributors your working on it. This ensures that two people do not do the same stuff / work. 

  * On the issue page, you will find a lot of different information about it. Below is a list explaining what each part means:
